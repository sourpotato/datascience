    "**Enter your repository information**\n",
    "Provide in the above form a URL or a **GitHub repository** that contains Jupyter notebooks, as well as a branch, tag, or commit hash. Launch will build your Binder repository. If you specify a path to a notebook file, the notebook will be opened in your browser after building.\n",
    "### Step 2\n",
    "We build a Docker image of your repository\n",
    "Binder will search for a dependency file, such as requirements.txt or **environment.yml**, in the repository's root directory (more details on more complex dependencies in documentation). The dependency files will be used to build a Docker image. If an image has already been built for the given repository, it will not be rebuilt. If a new commit has been made, the image will automatically be rebuilt.\n",
    "### Step 3\n",
    "Interact with your notebooks in a live environment!\n",
    "A JupyterHub server will **host your repository's contents**. We offer you a reusable link and badge to your live repository that you can easily share with others.\n",
